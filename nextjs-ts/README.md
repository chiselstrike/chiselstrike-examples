# ChiselStrike with Next.js TypeScript Example

This example showcases using Next.js and ChiselStrike with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

First, clone the files locally:

```bash
npx degit chiselstrike/chiselstrike-examples/nextjs-ts my-app
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should start Next.js and the ChiselStrike server at the same time. The Next.js server
should be accessible in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), whereas ChiselStrike server should be accessible in [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
